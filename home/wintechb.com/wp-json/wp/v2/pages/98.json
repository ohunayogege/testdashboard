Loans are secured by current assets with up to 80% loan to value. These loans are helpful to finance account receivables and inventory, and will assist your cash flow needs. Asset-Based Loans are typically structured as a revolving line of credit without a scheduled repayment and on an interest-only basis. We advance funds based on a percentage of the accounts receivable and inventory and, when such assets convert to cash, the advances are repaid accordingly. You can borrow, repay and re-borrow as needed over the life of the loan facility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lines of Credit<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Deutsche Finance is committed to helping you grow your business.
